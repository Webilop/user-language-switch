User Language Switch is a WordPress multilingual plugin that you can use to build multilingual websites. It displays flags to visitors that your users can use to browse your website in different languages. If you prefer, you can deactivate flags and user shortcodes and functions to create your own language switch.

Admin users can set default language for your website and registered users can set language they want to see your website by default. User Language Switch allows to set language for back-end and front-end independently.

When content is linked, a language prefix is added in URLs of content in secondary languages. The plugin always redirect to URLs with language prefix for content in secondary language, in this way there are no different URLs pointing to the same content and hurting your SEO. This plugin is compatible with SEO plugins like Yoast SEO.

It requires [you install different languages in your website](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language) and provide translation of your content, **it doesn't translate content automatically**. User Language Switch requires nice permalinks and URL rewriting enabled.

User Language Switch was created by [Webilop team](http://webilop.com/) and it is **free**. If you need help, you can use [the plugin support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/user-language-switch) or don't hesitate to [contact us](http://webilop.com/contact-us/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is User Language Switch? =

User Language Switch is a WordPress translation plugin that allows admin users to set the default language for the website and also include translations of pages, posts, custom post types, menus and sidebars. Visitors and users registered can see the website using any of its translations available.

= I only see English in the list of available languages =

Probably you don't have any other language installed in your WordPress installation nor in your theme. Take a look to the [instructions to install other languages to your WordPress website](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language).

= I don't see the option to set the language and translations of my posts and pages =

Go to the post or page edition page, scroll to the top of the page and click on tab "Screen Options", then check the option "Language".

= My posts and pages doesn't appear on the option to add translations =

When you are creating or editing a post, page or custom post page, you can assign as translations posts, pages and custom post types that are already published and that have a language assigned.

= I click on a flag to see the translation of my page, but I don't see content translated =

First check if your translation have been linked to your post, page or custom post in the edition page. If there is no translation available, then the content of the default language is displayed though other sections of the page could appear in the correct language.

= I don't see my posts in the blog =

By default the plugin filter posts in languages different to the language you are looking in the website. You can deactivate this feature in the settings page of the plugin. If a post doesn't have a language assigned, then the plugin considers the post in the default language the website.

= Where do I obtain the content translated for my page? =

The plugin doesn't translate content automatically, we recommend professional translations for websites instead automatic translations provided by online tools. Webilop team can help you to find professional translators for your website.

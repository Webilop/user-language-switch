== Description ==
User Language Switch allows each backend user to set the language displayed in the back-end and front-end of the site. ULS also allows to associate the original version and the translation of pages, posts and custom post types through custom fields in an easy and friendly way.
You can easily create the language links by adding the [uls-language-selector] shortcode.
The available languages are taken from the current theme and the wordpress installation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I only see English among the user language switch options =

If the only available option you see in the user language optons is English, it is because you don't have any other language available in your wordpress installation nor in your theme.
Make sure you create a 'languages' folder in your theme folder containing the .mo and .po files that correspond to the languages you will use in your blog.
